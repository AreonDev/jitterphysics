# jitterphysics
Lightweight managed physics engine

This is a fork of jitter-physics which can be found [here](https://code.google.com/p/jitterphysics)  
Primary use of it is in our 3D game framework [FreezingArcher](https://github.com/fin-ger/FreezingArcher)

We just want to apply smaller patches and improvements to ensure good integration into our framework.
