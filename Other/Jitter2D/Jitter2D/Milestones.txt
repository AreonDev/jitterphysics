Milestones
======

 - Milestone 1 - 
	Library compiles and correctly integrates both linear and angular velocity and position/orientation. Basic demo/test-bed app in place. 

- Milestone 2 -
	Speculative contacts seem to work.

- Milestone 3 -
	Basic collision resolution seems to work. Still a few bugs near the edges of boxes.
